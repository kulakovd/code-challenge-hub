# CodeChallengeHub

This repository contains test tasks on different languages, frameworks and technologies.
The main goal is to provide a simple way to test your skills or learn something new.

Tasks usually are not very complex and can be completed in 3-4 hours. 
Each task has a README file with detailed description and requirements.
Any additional files or instructions are also provided in the task folder.

## How to work with the tasks

Feel free to perform a task in any way you like. There are no strict rules but here are some recommendations:
- To get used to the development process, try to follow the same workflow as you would do in a real project:
    - Use git for each task and commit your changes regularly.
    - Write a README file with instructions on how to run the application and any other necessary documentation.
    - If any libraries or frameworks are used (other than specified in the task), mention them in the README.

- If you are not familiar with the language or technology, try to learn the basics first.

- If you don't fit in the time limit, don't worry. You can spend as much time as you need to complete the task or split it into several sessions. The main goal is to learn something new and have fun.

- You can perform a task either alone or with a team. Also, you can try pair programming with a friend or colleague.

- It's not necessary to complete all the requirements. Feel free to skip some of them if you don't have enough time or knowledge or just don't want to do them.
