# Test Task: JavaScript Implementation of a 3D Cube Renderer using WebGL

## Objective

Develop a simple web application using JavaScript and WebGL that renders a 3D cube. The cube should be rotatable based on user input.

## Requirements

1. WebGL for Rendering:
   - Use WebGL to render a 3D cube in the browser.
2. User Interaction:
   - Implement controls to rotate the cube around its axes (X, Y, Z).
   - Controls can be keyboard events or UI elements on the webpage.
3. Responsive Canvas:
    - The WebGL canvas should resize appropriately with the browser window.
4. Code Quality:
    - Code should be well-organized and commented.
    - Use modern JavaScript practices.

## Bonus (Optional)

1. Cube Customization:
    - Allow the user to change the color of the cube.
2. Lighting and Textures:
    - Implement basic lighting and texture mapping.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Functionality: The cube renders correctly and can be rotated as per user input.
2. Code Quality: Clean, readable, and well-organized code.
3. UI/UX Design: Intuitive and user-friendly interface for controlling the cube.
4. Efficiency: Optimized rendering loop and memory usage.
5. Bonus Features: Implementation of bonus features adds value.

## Time Limit

- Complete the task within 4 hours.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the project as a public or private GitHub repository.
- Ensure the repository contains clear commit history to demonstrate your workflow.
- Include a README file with instructions on how to run the application and any other necessary documentation.
- If any libraries or frameworks are used (other than WebGL), mention them in the README.

## Additional Notes

- Start by setting up a simple WebGL context and rendering loop.
- Focus first on the core requirements before moving to the bonus features.
- Test the application in different browsers and window sizes.
