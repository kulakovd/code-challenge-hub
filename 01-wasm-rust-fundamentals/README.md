# Test Task: Prime Number Checker with WebAssembly and Rust

## Objective

Create a web application that allows users to check if a number is prime. The prime checking algorithm should be implemented in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly for optimal performance. The task is designed to be completed in approximately 3 hours.

## Requirements

1. Rust and WebAssembly:
   - Implement a function in Rust that checks if a number is prime.
   - Compile this function to WebAssembly.
2. Web Frontend:
   - Build a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.
   - Implement a UI where users can input a number to check its primality.
   - Display the result on the web page.
3. Integration:
   - Load the WebAssembly module and integrate it into the frontend.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and readability
- Proper compilation and integration of Rust and WebAssembly
- Functionality and user experience

## Deliverables

- Source code for Rust and WebAssembly
- Frontend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- A README file detailing how to run the project and any dependencies

## Time Limit

This task is designed to be completed in approximately 3 hours.

## Additional Notes

Feel free to use any additional libraries or frameworks you find useful for this task, but make sure to include them in your README. Good luck!
